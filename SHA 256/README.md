This code is ideal for demonstrating parallel processing and the fundamentals of Proof-of-Work mechanisms used in blockchain systems.

This Python script is a parallelized solution for finding a nonce (number used once) that, when combined with a given string of names, produces a SHA-256 hash with a specified number of leading zeros. The script utilizes Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing module to speed up the process by leveraging multiple CPU cores to perform the computation in parallel.

Key Features:

1. SHA-256 Hashing: The script hashes a string consisting of names and a nonce using the SHA-256 algorithm, ensuring a secure and widely used hashing mechanism.

2. Targeting Leading Zeros: The goal is to find a hash that begins with a predefined number of leading zeros (max_zeros), a concept inspired by Proof-of-Work in blockchain technology.
   
3. Parallel Processing: By dividing the search space across all available CPU cores, the script improves efficiency and reduces the time needed to find a valid nonce.
   
4. Dynamic Work Distribution: Each process starts with a unique initial nonce and increments it by the total number of processes, ensuring non-overlapping searches.

5. Graceful Termination: Once a process finds a valid nonce, the program terminates all other processes to save resources.
