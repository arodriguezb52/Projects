This project implements a sentiment analyzer to create a stock portfolio based on financial news. The code uses the Loughran & McDonald financial sentiment dictionary to analyze the sentiment of news articles related to Dow Jones companies. Based on the sentiment scores, the analyzer identifies companies with positive news sentiment and selects stocks for a portfolio. The tool calculates the portfolioâ€™s beta and return, enabling comparison with manually curated portfolios. This project demonstrates the integration of sentiment analysis in financial decision-making and highlights the relationship between risk, sentiment, and returns.
