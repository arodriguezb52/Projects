Overview 

This Robo-Advisor is a Python-based tool designed to assist users in planning for retirement by offering personalized financial advice. It calculates life expectancy, estimates the years remaining until retirement, and recommends an optimal investment portfolio based on user inputs. The program leverages Social Security Administration (SSA) life expectancy tables and adapts asset allocation based on the user’s risk tolerance and time horizon.
